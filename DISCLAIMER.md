# Legal Disclaimer

**READ THIS CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THIS SOFTWARE**

## Not Legal Advice

This software (the "Tool") is provided for **informational and research purposes only**. It does **NOT** constitute professional legal advice, and must not be relied upon as a substitute for professional legal counsel.

### What This Means

- **No Attorney-Client Relationship**: Use of this Tool does not create an attorney-client relationship (relación abogado-cliente)
- **No Professional Responsibility**: The authors and contributors assume no professional responsibility for decisions made based on information from this Tool
- **Verification Required**: ALL legal information, citations, and conclusions must be independently verified with official sources and qualified legal professionals before being relied upon

## Professional Use Warnings

### For Legal Professionals

If you are a lawyer (abogado), legal researcher, or other legal professional:

- **Malpractice Risk**: Relying on unverified information from this Tool in professional legal work may constitute professional malpractice (responsabilidad profesional)
- **Professional Obligations**: You remain solely responsible for verifying all citations, statutes, and legal positions before advising clients or filing documents
- **Professional Rules**: Members of the Barra Mexicana, Colegio de Abogados (BMCA) and the Ilustre y Nacional Colegio de Abogados de México must comply with applicable codes of professional ethics (Código de Ética Profesional) when using AI tools
- **Client Disclosure**: Consider whether professional ethics rules require disclosing AI tool use to clients

### Duty of Independent Verification

**YOU MUST VERIFY EVERYTHING.** Do not cite, quote, or rely on any provision, case law, or legal interpretation from this Tool without:

1. Checking the official source (Diario Oficial de la Federación (DOF) at dof.gob.mx and the Cámara de Diputados legislation portal)
2. Verifying the provision is currently in force (vigente) and has not been amended (reformada) or repealed (abrogada)
3. Reading the full context of cited provisions
4. Consulting jurisprudence (tesis and jurisprudencia) and legislative history (exposición de motivos) for interpretation
5. Considering how recent legal developments may affect the matter

## Data Authority and Limitations

### Source Authority

This Tool aggregates data from official Mexican legal databases. However:

| Source Type | Authority Level | Use Case |
|------------|----------------|----------|
| **Official government databases (DOF, Cámara de Diputados)** | Authoritative | Statute text (primary reference) |
| **Community/open-data sources** | Supplementary | Case law, cross-references (verify independently) |
| **Treaty/international databases** | Authoritative for international law | International obligations metadata |

**CRITICAL**: Community-maintained resources are **NOT** official government publications. While generally reliable, they may contain transcription errors, outdated information, or incomplete coverage.

### Commercial Legal Databases

For professional legal work, **always cross-check with commercial legal databases** such as:

- IUS (Suprema Corte de Justicia de la Nación), Orden Jurídico Nacional, LexisNexis México, vLex

These services provide editorial oversight, comprehensive annotations, and professional-grade currency guarantees that this Tool **cannot** provide.

## Currency and Staleness

### No Real-Time Updates

- Database updates are **manual** and may lag official publications by **weeks or months**
- Mexican law changes continuously through new statutes (leyes), reforms (reformas), decrees (decretos), and court decisions (sentencias)
- **Last-updated timestamps** in tool responses indicate data age, but should be treated as unreliable

### Staleness Warnings

The Tool includes staleness warnings when data is >30 days old. **These warnings are not exhaustive**:

- Even "fresh" data may be outdated if recent amendments were published in the DOF
- Staleness warnings do not guarantee completeness or accuracy
- Always check official sources for the current legal position

### Amendments and Repeals

- A provision marked "in force" (vigente) may have been:
  - Amended (reformada) after the last database update
  - Repealed (abrogada) but not yet removed from the database
  - Subject to transitional articles (artículos transitorios) affecting its applicability
- The Tool does **NOT** automatically track amendments in real-time

## Coverage Gaps

### What's Missing

This Tool does **NOT** include:

1. **Complete jurisprudence** -- Coverage of tesis aisladas and jurisprudencia from SCJN and circuit courts is limited
2. **Historical statute versions** -- Limited availability of historical provision wording prior to reforms
3. **Legal commentary (doctrina)** -- No editorial annotations, academic commentary, or practice guides
4. **Unpublished decisions** -- Lower court decisions and administrative resolutions largely absent
5. **Full legislative history** -- Limited coverage of exposiciones de motivos and parliamentary debates
6. **State-level legislation** -- Coverage of individual state codes and laws (legislación estatal) may be incomplete
7. **Municipal regulations (reglamentos municipales)** -- Local government regulations are not covered
8. **NOM/NMX standards** -- Official Mexican Standards (Normas Oficiales Mexicanas) coverage may be limited

### Impact on Professional Use

These gaps mean:

- **Incomplete Legal Research**: Tool results are inherently incomplete and may miss critical authorities
- **Context Missing**: Without doctrina and exposiciones de motivos, interpretation may be incorrect
- **Federal System Blind Spots**: Mexico operates a federal system; state and municipal legislation may differ significantly
- **Jurisprudential Gaps**: Without complete tesis and jurisprudencia, the binding interpretation of provisions may be missed

4. **Professional Judgment**: Apply independent legal analysis and professional judgment
5. **Document Sources**: Cite official sources in legal work, not this Tool
6. **Update Check**: Before finalizing legal work, check for recent reforms (reformas) and jurisprudencia
